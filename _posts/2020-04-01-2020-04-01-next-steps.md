- [x] Make sure data is properly registered. I visually inspected all of the path/rows over montana
  after I stack them, and they all looked perfectly registered.
- [ ] See if I can download the missing data in over Montana, shown in the first figure [here]({%
  post_url 2020-03-31-2020-03-31-data-description %})
- [ ] Investigate why the 1m param network (described [here]({% post_url 2020-03-31-2020-03-31-model-comparison-table %})) did better than networks with way more parameters
- [ ] Train models with random start dates, as described [here]({% post_url 2020-03-31-2020-03-31-data-description %})
- [ ] Add more data: use all 7 bands available for surface reflectance data.
- [ ] Retrain recurrent networks on the same dataset as all the other networks.
- [ ] Experiment with training networks with tiles taken over the centroids of irrigated polygons
- [ ] Weight orthogonality?
- [ ] Cycle-gan to pretrain the network. Pretrain the network on labels generated by another GAN (or VAE),
to get a more accurate representation of the training data without having to heavily oversample the
data.
