# Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution

This post will have a different flavor from the rest. I recently read ["Perceptual Losses for
Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155) by Justin Johnson,
Alexandre Alahi, and Li Fei-Fei. This paper details how to do real-time style transfer, similar to
what was proposed in the original style transfer paper by [Gatys et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576).

The original paper by Gatys et al outlines a technique to transfer styles of images onto other
images by using a deep convolutional neural network ([VGG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556)) to
extract features and "style" from an image.
