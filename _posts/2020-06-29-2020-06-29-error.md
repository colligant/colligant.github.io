Research log, June 29. 
I am currently writing the paper on irrigation, and I just discovered something annoying.
Since U-NET does two convolutions before downsampling/after upsampling, I decided to write
a function that does just that.  

```python
def conv_block(x):
    x = Conv2d(x)
    x = BN2d(x)
    x = ReLU(x)
    x = Conv2d(x)
    x = BN2d(x)
    x = ReLU(x)
    return x
```
I was checking the model architecture as I'm writing it up in the paper and it turns out
I commented out the first batch norm call. I doubt this will have a significant effect on the
performance of the model, but it's still something that I have to sort out.
