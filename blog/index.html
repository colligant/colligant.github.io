So many ideas, so little time...

Prerequisite:
What skills are <i>actually</i> important for being a successful data scientist?
<br>
I've applied to almost 100 jobs so far in my search, and kept records of all of
the job postings. Let's write a Python script to scrape all of the descriptions
and analyze for technical keywords. I'm going to use git to host all of the code
files, but I'll link them on this page.

</br></br><big><b>The Scraper</b></big>
I wrote a little script in python to count words that appear in job postings.
After removing common words, we're left with a histogram of words like this:


It seems important to learn SQL and how to deploy a model in real-time.
</br></br><big><b>Project Design</b></big>
I'm a recreational fly fisher (in Missoula, MT, who isn't?). The
"recreational" title means that I sometimes can't identify a bug that I find in
the river or what fly matches it. Flies are bits of foam and hair that are
designed to look like certain bugs, either on top of the water (dry flies) or
underneath (nymphs). Initally, I'm going to use a pretrained model (some image
classification model, like a ResNet) as an image embedder, and train it on
paired data in a semi-supervised fasion.
The pairs will consist of a real-life bug and the fly that best imitates it. 
There are a couple ways to skin this cat, but first is the data collection, then
maybe some labelling.
See below for a conceptual diagram of the flow of the project.
<br><br> 
0. Identify in-demand skills.
I wrote a script to do this, but realized that domain expert knowledge would be
much more useful. So I've decided to learn SQL and how to host a website (with a
continuously deployed ML model!) on Google App Engine. Often job requirements
ask how you've deployed and monitored models, so I'm going to do that.

<br> 
1. Collect image data by scraping the web. 
In process. The dataset is going to be a little more hands-on than I previously
thought. I'm going to MVP the model and make a website that is modular enough to
accept any trained model and database.
<br> 
2. Add said data into a MySQL database.
<br> 
3. Fine-tune a model to classify the flies (imitation and real) into their
classes - this will force the model to distinguish between different flies.
<br> 
4. Get pairs of flies that look similar (manual annotation), and use a
contrastive loss (SimCLR) to push their embeddings together.
<br>
5. Write a Google App Engine app (javascript?) that ingests a picture, searches it against the
vector database, and provides a few fly suggestions.
