The masked language modeling (MLM) objective plus reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) can only get us
so far in the search for AGI. There has to be a paradigm shift if progress is to continue - for example, algorithms
that can generate their own training data to iteratively improve on.

The issue, though, is that the search space of possible actions for a human-like agent is poorly defined compared to 
a game like chess or Go (the other RL algorithms that train agents to solve problems in 3-d environments are very 
impressive but similar in their constraints). There also
