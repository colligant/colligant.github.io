*scientific software engineer /ˌsīənˈtifik ˈsôf(t)ˌwer ˌenjəˈnir/ • Jack of all trades, master of some*


Scientific software engineers are often tasked with "making things work". This means jumping headfirst into an unfamiliar
field (biogeochemistry and biogeography, for example) and using computer science and formal problem-solving skills
to make rapid progress. Collaboration and communication with diverse stakeholders is crucial, given the
unfamiliar terrain that SSEs are
exposed to from day one. Their goals are a little different
from conventional software engineering goals, as deliverables often consist
of academic papers or software libraries for a specific analysis instead of the more conventional user/
client informed product. However, using conventional software engineering techniques (unit+integration testing,
automatic CI/CD, containerization, orchestration tools, Agile methodologies), can reduce both experiment time and
scientific overhead.

Some big wins I've achieved in my current role that I attribute to my computer science skills

- Sped up LPJ-EOSIM (a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM)) >1000x on NASA's NCCS Discover HPC, fixed all sorts of bugs
- Published a static diagnostic website to monitor model runs, allowing automated QA/QC on SOTA DGVMs
- Wrote an operational ETL pipeline for extracting data, running the model, and pushing results to NASA's Land Process
  Distributed Active Archive Center and the US Greenhouse Gas Center. Some context here - these models are often run
  less than one time per year. We now have the ability to run them every few weeks and provide up-to-date estimates of
  biospheric carbon and methane.
