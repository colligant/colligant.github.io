    subtitle: "Tom is a [scientific software engineer](/sse) at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center
      currently working on operationalizing the LPJ-EOSIM Dynamic Global
      Vegetation model.
      He's particularly interested in writing [simple
      code](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-John-Ousterhout/dp/1732102201)
      to enable impactful science and engineering, and believes that good software
      is a research accelerant. He's the main author of the
      [LPJ-EOSIM Wetland Methane
      products](https://earth.gov/ghgcenter/data-catalog/lpjeosim-wetlandch4-grid-v2)
      on the US Greenhouse Gas Center website. In the past, Tom has been a research scientist in Machine Learning at the University of Arizona and University of Montana.
      \n
      \n
      <br>
      In addition to his current work on the LPJ-EOSIM model, he's worked on a diverse range of projects including geospatial machine learning to classify irrigation with Landsat data,
      CNNs for sound classification, streamflow prediction, novel contrastive embedding techniques for protein retrieval, and eclipse-induced gravity
      wave detection. The most common throughline in his career has been the ability to write clean analytical code to further
      research and development goals."
