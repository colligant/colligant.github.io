      Hi! Iâ€™m Tom Colligan, a [scientific software engineer](/sse) by training, currently working at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. At NASA, I lead our efforts to operationalize the LPJ-EOSIM Dynamic Global Vegetation model, a process-based model developed for carbon cycle applications. I am interested in writing code to enable science and engineering projects that promote environmental sustainability and conservation, and believe that [clean code](/clean-code) is a research accelerant.
      
      I am the main author of the [LPJ-EOSIM Wetland Methane](https://earth.gov/ghgcenter/data-catalog/lpjeosim-wetlandch4-grid-v2) products on the US Greenhouse Gas Center website. Notably, this project provides state of the art estimates of wetland methane emissions on a near-real-time basis, allowing quick quantification and measuring of the response of wetlands to climate change. In the past, I was employed as a research scientist at the University of Arizona and University of Montana. My main research focus was basic machine learning in bioinformatics
      In addition to my current work on the LPJ-EOSIM model at NASA, I am involved in a range of projects including geospatial machine learning to classify irrigation with Landsat data, CNNs for sound classification, streamflow prediction, novel contrastive embedding techniques for protein retrieval, and eclipse-induced gravity wave detection.
      The most common throughline in my career has been the ability to write clean analytical code to further research and development goals.
