## About
Graduate student in computer science at the University of Montana. Advised by [Douglas
Brinkerhoff](https://dbrinkerhoff.org). My masters' thesis involves mapping irrigation across the
CONUS using LANDSAT data and neural networks. In a previous life, I was a physics student at the
University of Montana and recieved my B.A in 2018. While I was a physics student, I researched the
generation of gravity waves by solar eclipses. This work led to the opportunity to measure the
atmosphere's response to the total solar eclipse of July 2, 2019 in Chile (which involved travelling
to Chile!). I've also worked with [AASO](https://umt.edu/aaso/) for multiple summers, doing
everything from gravity wave research to embedded systems programming. 

This blog serves as a helpful place to share my research notes.
Occasionally I'll post tutorials or examples of interesting projects that I'm working on
[here](blog).
