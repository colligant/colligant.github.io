I wrote a lot of code this year (11k+ lines, tested), published data on LPDAAC, and ended up traveling for work quite a bit. I became much more familiar with the LPJ-EOSIM ecosystem, got on a few grants, and am going to be an author on at least two papers. If everything continues as is, it was a somewhat auspicious year [^2].\nI have a few goals for the upcoming year. Really, there are a ton of low hanging ML fruits in this field, so I’d like to be involved in one or two of those projects. Additionally, I’d like to hone my writing skills so that publications don’t become such a burden. Technically, I’m still making strides: learning AWS, unit testing, even things like IDE setup. One specific thing that I’d like to achieve is pushing the entire pipeline to AWS and codifying a release structure so that future users can update LPJ and products with minimal effort. Concretely, I’d like to connect with a mentor at NASA to help me with software development and attend a conference on scientific software dev.\nSo, let’s recap, starting at most recent.\nSubmitted LPJ-EOSIM simulations to TRENDYv13, the most recent version of the Global Carbon Budget’s land surface ensemble (and will be a coauthor!) Presented a plenary (read: keynote) presentation at ICOS 2024, on our work to do near real time carbon flux anomaly detection. Me, presenting work at ICOS (in Versailles. Cool experience). Did a ton of model improvement - meaning LPJ was sped up 100x in some cases! This timing is sort of inaccurate since it takes a ton of time for LPJ to run in the non-sped-up mode. Basically I refactored the I/O access patterns to allow better integration with the GPFS filesystem on NCCS Discover. Meaning I/O overhead (which previously was like 90% of the runtime (depending on number of threads of course)) was significantly reduced. Wrote a python package to format and upload LPJ-EOSIM data products to LPDAAC. I also read John Osterhout’s A Philosophy of Software Design and thought really hard about how to implement his axioms into my code. Set up the AWS infrastructure to push data to LPDAAC. This required quite a bit of interdisciplinary collaboration which was so rewarding to see through to the end. Ported LPJ to an AWS ParallelCluster which allowed two international PhD students to run LPJ in the cloud. I was also tech support for them. Entirely rewrote the infrastructure for distributing LPJ. There weren’t any tests and many of the R source files used old libraries. This looked like writing a bunch of tested Python. [^1] I wonder who actually finds this website. Sometimes I find myself in the bowels of the internet looking at random personal pages, which is either inspiring (wow! they are so consistent about cataloguing their thoughts!) or sort of depressing (huh. they only posted once, a “hello world” sort of thing. What happened?).\n[^2] That is, if my funding doesn’t run out.\n","wordCount":"547","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/reflections/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Tom Colligan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Tom Colligan (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Tom Colligan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/cv.pdf title=cv><span>cv</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/calendar.html title=meet><span>meet</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/reflections title=reflections><span class=active>reflections</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent"></h1></header><div class=post-content><p><em>reflections</em> / rəˈflekSH(ə)ns / • A log of achievements and
