This tendency was mentioned in A Philosophy of Software Design, and I’d like to remind myself to develop a little slower in the future. Attention to detail: iPhone recently let me know that I was receiving around 300 emails per week. I found myself losing the thread on some of them this year. My goal this year is to categorize important emails (this has already helped with organization).

This is just a huge signal that I need to write a Docker/Singularity image for this, and transition all the data publication code to the Docker image. Quality checking and examining new simulations is cumbersome. Specifically, re-running plotting code each time I need to change y or x limits involves a back-and-forth that’s wasting time. Investing some time in a non-static website to display line plots could be worth its effort. In addition, plotting COGs interactively (postGIS?) would really speed things up. Protecting my time: I enjoy helping others …and working remotely can be isolating. However, I need to find a balance between helping them and hindering myself.

I’d like to formalize the process of running production simulations. I looked back at a timeline that I created in February of this year.

For example, I was certain that I could do GCP, ML based downscaling and deployment, on demand NBP and CH4 simulations, and write a website for a methane newsletter. Of course, my taskload varied with ICOS, VICC, writing a paper, and the fact that some of my work depended on outside timelines. Still, my goal for this year is to write more realistic timelines.
